Storm Stream Processing Pipeline (Pure Kafka Streaming)
Processes real-time data streams with immediate compliance checking

This module implements Research Question 1 (RQ1): Stream processing approach
for real-time compliance monitoring. It demonstrates low-latency processing
of individual records with immediate violation detection and response.

Key Features:
- Real-time streaming data processing (Apache Storm topology with Kafka)
- Immediate HIPAA/GDPR compliance violation detection
- Real-time tokenization for privacy protection
- Low-latency metrics collection for research comparison
- Pure Kafka-based message streaming architecture

Architecture:
- Consumer: Subscribes to healthcare-stream and financial-stream topics
- Processor: Real-time compliance checking and anonymization
- Producer: Outputs processed data and violations to result topics

REQUIRES: Kafka must be running and accessible - no fallback mode

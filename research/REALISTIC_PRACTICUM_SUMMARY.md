# ðŸŽ“ **Master's Practicum - Quick Reference**

## ðŸ“Š **What You Actually Built**

### **1. Working Multi-Engine System**

- **Apache Spark** for batch processing (213 records/sec)
- **Apache Storm** for stream processing (486 records/sec)
- **Apache Flink** for hybrid processing (475 records/sec)
- **React frontend** with real-time monitoring
- **Flask backend** with modular API design

### **2. Practical Compliance Implementation**

- **HIPAA**: PHI detection, SSN patterns (66.7% detection rate)
- **GDPR**: Consent management, data retention (58.3% detection rate)
- **PCI-DSS**: Credit card tokenization
- **Modular rule engine** for extensible compliance

### **3. Performance Optimization**

- **Clean timing separation** (eliminated I/O contamination)
- **Microflow processing** (1000-record batches)
- **Bounded memory** processing (prevents crashes)
- **Batch database operations** (performance improvement)

### **4. Anonymization Comparison**

- **K-anonymity**: Good for batch processing
- **Tokenization**: Fast for stream processing
- **Differential privacy**: Basic research implementation

WE have research practicum going on and we have couple of research questions and the implementation we are thinking :



Here it is :



Dear Professor,

Hope you're doing well! It's been a couple of months since we last connected, and I wanted to update you on our practicum progress and get your thoughts on our direction.

We're working to balance research and implementation effectively and would appreciate your feedback on whether we're on the right track.

Research Question 1: Batch vs Real-time Verification

How do batch verification and real-time automated verification compare in ensuring compliance and detecting violations in data pipelines?



Research:

Existing data pipelines (batch/stream processing)

Comparative pipeline selection and best practices

GDPR/HIPAA compliance violations for rule sets

Impact of delayed compliance reporting



Implementation:

Clone/build hybrid pipelines for both processing types

Generate mock datasets with compliance violations

Create rule sets and test with varying data volumes (1GB-50GB+)

Measure detection rates, latency, and resource utilization



Research Question 2: Anonymization Technique Comparison

Which anonymization technique best balances data utility and privacy: k-anonymity, differential privacy, or tokenization?



Research:

Evaluation metrics for anonymization algorithms

Comparative analysis of the three techniques



Implementation:

Implement techniques in our pipeline

Test speed, memory usage, and computational overhead with large datasets



Synthetic Datasets: Healthcare (HIPAA), Financial (GDPR), IoT sensor data, E-commerce data

Do you think our approach balances research and implementation appropriately? Any suggestions on our direction?

Would love to discuss this further at your convenience.



Best regards,

Now I need your help finding existing research paper or existing data pipeline for processing batch and stream data .



And we would ned reasoning as well as to which pipeline we are picking and why and how to set it up and next steps

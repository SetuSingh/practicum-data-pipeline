# Secure Data Pipeline Architecture Design

## Overview

This document outlines three distinct processing architectures for secure data pipeline implementation with GDPR/HIPAA compliance monitoring and anonymization capabilities.

## Architecture 1: Batch Processing Pipeline

### Components Architecture

```
Data Sources → Collection Manager → Batch Processor → Anonymization Engine → Compliance Validator → Secure Storage
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                   ↓                    ↓                ↓
[CSV/DB] → [Data Annotation] → [Apache Spark] → [k-anonymity/DP] → [Rule Engine] → [Encrypted Store]
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                   ↓                    ↓                ↓
Metadata DB ← Processing Logs ← Batch Metrics ← Privacy Metrics ← Compliance Logs ← Audit Trail
```

### Key Components:

- **Collection Manager**: Data ingestion with consent policy annotation
- **Batch Processor**: Apache Spark for large-scale data processing
- **Anonymization Engine**: Configurable k-anonymity, differential privacy, tokenization
- **Compliance Validator**: GDPR/HIPAA rule engine with violation detection
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana for batch job monitoring

### Advantages:

- High throughput for large datasets
- Comprehensive compliance auditing
- Resource-efficient for periodic processing

### Limitations:

- Delayed violation detection
- Higher latency for compliance response

## Architecture 2: Real-time Stream Processing Pipeline

### Components Architecture

```
Data Streams → Stream Ingestion → Real-time Processor → Live Anonymization → Compliance Monitor → Event Store
      ↓              ↓                    ↓                    ↓                   ↓               ↓
[Kafka Topics] → [Kafka Connect] → [Apache Flink] → [Streaming DP] → [CEP Engine] → [Event DB]
      ↓              ↓                    ↓                    ↓                   ↓               ↓
Schema Registry ← Stream Metrics ← Processing Stats ← Privacy Budget ← Alert System ← Real-time Dashboard
```

### Key Components:

- **Stream Ingestion**: Apache Kafka for high-throughput data streaming
- **Real-time Processor**: Apache Flink for low-latency stream processing
- **Live Anonymization**: Streaming differential privacy with dynamic ε allocation
- **Compliance Monitor**: Complex Event Processing (CEP) for real-time violation detection
- **Event Store**: Time-series database for compliance event storage

### Advantages:

- Immediate violation detection
- Real-time privacy protection
- Continuous compliance monitoring

### Limitations:

- Higher computational overhead
- Complex privacy budget management

## Architecture 3: Hybrid Adaptive Processing Pipeline

### Components Architecture

```
Data Router → Processing Decision Engine → [Batch Path | Stream Path] → Unified Anonymization → Compliance Aggregator
     ↓                    ↓                        ↓                           ↓                      ↓
[Smart Router] → [ML-based Classifier] → [Adaptive Processing] → [Context-aware Privacy] → [Unified Compliance]
     ↓                    ↓                        ↓                           ↓                      ↓
Data Profiler ← Decision Metrics ← Performance Monitor ← Privacy Budget Manager ← Compliance Dashboard
```

### Intelligent Routing Logic:

- **Data Sensitivity**: High sensitivity → Stream processing
- **Data Volume**: Large batches → Batch processing
- **Compliance Urgency**: Critical violations → Stream processing
- **Resource Availability**: Low resources → Batch processing

### Adaptive Privacy Budget Allocation:

- **Dynamic ε Adjustment**: Based on data sensitivity and processing context
- **Budget Conservation**: Batch processing for comprehensive analysis
- **Real-time Protection**: Stream processing for immediate threats

### Key Innovations:

- **ML-based Processing Decision**: Machine learning classifier for optimal routing
- **Context-aware Anonymization**: Privacy technique selection based on data characteristics
- **Unified Compliance Monitoring**: Combined batch and stream compliance validation
